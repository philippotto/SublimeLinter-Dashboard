# SublimeLinter-Dashboard

Provides a dashboard like user interface for the [SublimeLinter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter) package.
The dashboard is a new view which contains a list of all linting errors/warnings in all views of the active window.
Switching to an warning/error is as simple as double clicking or pressing enter on a line of the view.
